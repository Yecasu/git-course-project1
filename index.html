            <b>Sam</b> splits his time between full-time work, school and his family. He is loving his new job as a web-developer and following BYU sports, but his favorite time is spent having fun with his family.
            <br><br>
            Sam has one class to finish at BYU in order to earn his degree and is looking forward to closing that chapter.

          <div class="text hidden about_parker"> 
            <b>Parker</b> is the energy that fuels our home! He loves trains, cars, balls, running up and down the hall, and sneaking up on people. He is so much fun and so very sweet.
            <br><br>
            Parker will turn two this year and can't wait for the season to turn back to summer so he can spend all his time outside again.
